**Objectives(Problem Statement):**
    Disease detection is a critical task for farmers and also many plants disease cannot be identified with our naked eyes. They follow shortcuts of using chemical pesticides which give side effects to consumable foods. 
    Protecting crops before the pest attack is needed for the current situation which makes life healthier for consumers and a better yield for the farmers.  Monitoring every single crop couldn’t be done by a single farmer but with the help of developing technology like artificial intelligence and expert knowledge from various fields, it’s possible.
_Why to choose Tomatoes?_
    Tomatoes are one of the most widely cultivated food crops throughout the world due to its high nutritive value. It occupies the fourth level between world vegetables and it affects the production by 30 -50 percent
**Feasibility & Scalability:**
      Agriculture monitoring is the much needed reducing human intervention in practice. Day by day demand for food is reaching its high peak and without the execution of the modern methods in agriculture, it is very hard to achieve the increasing demand. Agriculture monitoring is the prime concern as it helps to reduce labor and increase production. Artificial Intelligence has been implemented in crop selection and to help the farmer in the selection of the fertilizers. With the help of the database which the user has gathered and specified to the system, the machine communicates among themselves to decide which crop is suitable for harvesting and also the fertilizers which promote the maximum growth. Deep learning has a wide reach and its application in the industry has received tremendous advancement. Using deep learning is an added advantage over machine learning and it adds depth to machine learning. 

**##Problem Impact:**
    Emergence of accurate technique in the field of leaf based image classification has shown better results. So, we have decided to help the farmers by distinguishing the diseases and to provide a better solution. Most of the farmers are not educated and the information must reach them in a correct manner and also for their understanding ,language does matter the most. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces a large work of monitoring in big farms of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects the symptoms of diseases i.e. when they appear on plant leaves. This also minimizes the use of agrochemical and ensures both quality and quantity of agricultural products.

_**Our solution_**
**Need for innovation:**
    Protecting crops before the pest attack is needed for the current situation which makes life healthier for consumers and a better yield for the farmers.  Monitoring every single crop couldn’t be done by a single farmer but with the help of developing technology like artificial intelligence and expert knowledge from various fields, it’s possible. 
**Agriculture problem & Consumer needs:** 
    Attack of Pests and diseases in crops. Identifying diseases through the naked eye makes it difficult for the farmers so we are keen to help them through these problems. Along with this, monitoring the huge hectares of crops such as weather monitoring, soil condition monitoring are difficult for the farmers. Also, water logging occurs mostly without the knowledge of farmers which affects the plant so it can also be resolved with our innovation. 
Consumers can be satisfied with more good products and healthy products by this innovation. It also saves a lot of water that is being wasted and correct monitoring of crops and pest control.
**Market for innovation:** 
    It provides more efficient ways to produce, harvest and sell essential crops. The yield percentage can be increased and the connection between pest vendor agency and farmer will lead to effective use of fertilizers and pesticides for the correct diseases. This implementation emphasizes checking defective crops and also it improves the potential for healthy crop production. It also has the potential to solve the challenges that farmers face such as climate variation, an infestation of pests and weeds that reduces yields.
